# Amazon Rekognition Shot Detection Demo using Segment API

This demo solution demostrates how to use [Amazon Rekognition Video Segment Detection](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/rekognition/latest/dg/segments.html) to detect segments _whenever a camera shot has changed_ and technical cues such as _Opening Credits_, _Content_, _End Credits_, _Black Frames_, _Slate_, _Studio Logo_, and _Color Bar_.

The animated GIFs illustrate how this demo solution works.

Check out our blog post, [Streamline content preparation and quality control for VOD platforms using Amazon Rekognition Video](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/media/streamline-content-preparation-and-quality-control-for-vod-platforms-using-amazon-rekognition-video/) to learn more about the new Segment Version 2 API.

__

# Architecture overview

The solution is designed with [serverless architecture](https://aws.amazon.com/serverless/). It consists of three components, a backend AWS Step Functions state machine, a frontend web user interface, and an Amazon API Gateway RESTful endpoint. The backend state machine uses AWS Elemental MediaConvert to create proxy video and JPEG thumbnails (for streaming and analysis purposes), and runs Amazon Rekognition Video Segment detection to extract the shot segments and technical cues metadata. The frontend web user interface allows user to upload video(s), monitors the detection process, and view the detection results. The frontend and backend communicate through an RESTful API endpoint created by Amazon API Gateway.

The architectural diagram below illustrates an overview of the solution.

![Overview](./deployment/images/shot-detection-architecture.jpg)

User first signs in to the web portal using Amazon Cognito service. The web application is hosted on an Amazon Simple Storage Service (S3), a ```web bucket``` indicated in the diagram. The web bucket is protected by Amazon CloudFront distribution with [Origin Access Identity (OAID)](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudFront/latest/DeveloperGuide/private-content-restricting-access-to-s3.html) which restricts direct access to the bucket.

Upon sign-in, the user is authenticated and is given a temporary security credential to access limited AWS resources such as permission to call a specific Amazon API Gateway endpoint and permission to upload video(s) to a specific Amazon Simple Storage Service (S3) bucket, the ```source bucket```. The source S3 bucket is configured to take advantage of [Amazon S3 Transfer Acceleration](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/transfer-acceleration.html).

The analysis workflow can only be accessed through Amazon API Gateway endpoint where the incoming requests are authenticated with AWS_IAM, the temporary security credential. The API endpoint invokes a lambda function to handle the incoming requests.

An Amazon S3 logs bucket is created to store access logs from Amazon S3 buckets and Amazon CloudFront distribution.

# Building and customizing the solution

## Build Environment
The sample code is written in NodeJS v14.x. Before you start, please make sure NodeJS has been installed. You would also need to create an Amazon Simple Storage Service (Amazon S3) bucket to store the build artifacts. 


### NodeJS
Make sure you install NodeJS 14.x onto your system.

For MAC user, download and install from [nodejs.org](https://nodejs.org/en/download/). Alternatively, you can also use Homebrew.

For Linux or Amazon EC2 user, follow [Tutorial: Setting Up Node.js on an Amazon EC2 Instance](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sdk-for-javascript/v2/developer-guide/setting-up-node-on-ec2-instance.html)

For Windows 10 user, make sure to install [Windows Subsystem for Linux](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install-win10) before installing NodeJS. The build and deploy scripts are written in Bash script.


### AWS CLI

The **deploy-s3-dist.sh** shell script uploads the build artifacts to your S3 bucket; thus, it requires [AWS CLI](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/cli-chap-install.html) to be installed and configured.

```shell
# after AWS CLI is installed, run the command and follow the instruction to configure your profile

aws configure

```

### Amazon S3 Bucket

Create a S3 bucket to store the build artifacts: AWS CloudFormation (CFN) templates and Amazon Lambda packages.

Note: make sure to choose the region you intend to run the workflow; for example, ```us-east-1``` region.


__

## To build the sample code,
* Clone the repository

```shell
git clone git@github.com:awslabs/amazon-rekognition-shot-detection-demo-using-segment-api.git

```

* Change directory to **deployment** and run **build-s3-dist.sh**

```shell
cd amazon-rekognition-shot-detection-demo-using-segment-api/deployment
bash build-s3-dist.sh --bucket your-bucket

```

* Deploy the package to your S3 bucket

```shell
bash deploy-s3-dist.sh --bucket your-bucket

# optionally you could specify different AWS CLI Profile,
# AWS CLI profile (default to 'default')
bash deploy-s3-dist.sh --bucket your-bucket \
--profile DevProfile

```

Now you should have all the code packages and CFN templates uploaded to your S3 bucket.

Log in to [AWS S3 Console](https://s3.console.aws.amazon.com/s3/home) and navigate to the bucket you created.

Make sure you see the following files under **/shot-detection-demo/2.0.0/**

| Name | Description |
|:---  |:------------|
| main.template | main cloudformation template to create the solution |
| shot-detection-stack.template | template to create resources |
| shot-detection-demo-custom-resources-2.0.0.zip | a package of custom resource lambda function used by cloudformation template |
| shot-detection-demo-api-2.0.0.zip | a package of lambad functiom that handles GET, POST, and OPTIONS requests from Amazon API Gateway endpoint |
| shot-detection-demo-core-lib-2.0.0.zip | a lambda layer package of the core library shared among other lambda functions |
| shot-detection-demo-mediainfo-2.0.0.zip | a lambda layer package of mediainfo used to extract media information of uploaded videos |
| shot-detection-demo-step-2.0.0.zip | a package of lamba function contained the actual implementation of each state of AWS Step Functions state machine |
| shot-detection-demo-status-updater-2.0.0.zip | a package of lambda function to receive events from Amazon CloudWatch Event and Amazon Simple Notification Service (SNS) and to send task result signaling the AWS Step Functions state machine execution when a task is completed or failed. |

# Launching your customized solution

This section covers two different methods to deploy your customized solution: 1) using AWS CloudFormation Console and 2) using AWS CLI command.

### Method 1: Using AWS CloudFormation Console
* Log on to [AWS CloudFormation Console](https://console.aws.amazon.com/cloudformation/home)
* Click on **Create stack** with new resources (standard)
* Follow the [instruction](#launch-solution-with-aws-cloudformation-stack) described earlier. **Make sure to specify the S3 location of your customized CloudFormation template under the _Amazon S3 URL_ field**.

### Method 2: Using AWS CLI Command
* Create a JSON input file as follows and save it locally; ie., cfn-input.json

```json
[
  {
    "ParameterKey": "Email",
    "ParameterValue": "yourname@email.com"
  },
  {
    "ParameterKey": "PriceClass",
    "ParameterValue": "Use Only U.S., Canada and Europe [PriceClass_100]"
  }
]

```
* Run the following AWS CLI command to create the stack

```shell
aws cloudformation create-stack \
--stack-name shot-detection \
--template-url https://your-bucket.s3.amazonaws.com/shot-detection-demo/latest/main.template  \
--parameters file://cfn-input.json \
--capabilities "CAPABILITY_IAM"

```

# Deleting the demo solution
To delete the demo solution, simply delete the CloudFormation stack that was deployed earlier.

**Important note:** deleteing the CloudFormation stack does _NOT_ remove the following resources. Therefore, make sure you manually clean up these resources to avoid potential recurring cost.
* Amazon S3 bucket (web)
* Amazon S3 bucket (source)
* Amazon S3 bucket (logs)

__


# Security

When you build systems on AWS infrastructure, security responsibilities are shared between you and AWS. This shared model can reduce your operational burden as AWS operates, manages, and controls the components from the host operating system and virtualization layer down to the physical security of the facilities in which the services operate. For more information about security on AWS, visit the [AWS Security Center](https://aws.amazon.com/security).

## Server-Side Encryption
AWS highly recommends that customers encrypt sensitive data in transit and at rest. This demo solution automatically encrypts image files and metadata at rest with [Amazon Simple Storage Service (Amazon S3) Server-Side Encryption (SSE)](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/serv-side-encryption.html).


## Amazon CloudFront
This demo solution deploys a static website [hosted](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/WebsiteHosting.html) in an Amazon S3 bucket. To help reduce latency and improve security, this solution includes an Amazon CloudFront distribution with an origin access identity, which is a special CloudFront user that helps restrict access to the solution’s website bucket contents. For more information, see [Restricting Access to Amazon S3 Content by Using an Origin Access Identity](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudFront/latest/DeveloperGuide/private-content-restricting-access-to-s3.html).
